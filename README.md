# Solar_Panel_Detection_Mapping_Satalite_YOLOv5
This is an end-to-end real world computer vision project, utilizing satellite images of Amman in order to detect and map the location of PV solar panels in comercial and residential settings. The YOLOv5 deep learning model was trained by manually labeled images by me. The trained model has a high precision performing the solar panel detection task.
