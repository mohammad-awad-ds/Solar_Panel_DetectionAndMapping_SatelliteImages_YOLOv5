# Solar_Panel_Detection_Mapping_Satalite_YOLOv5 (This ReadME is a work in progress)
This is an end-to-end real world computer vision project for the detection and mapping of solar panels in the city of Amman. 

The project scope covers the following:
- Has a pipeline for scrapping tiles (satellite images as raw data) based on coordinates (ex: city of Amman) using an API.
- Preprocesses the tiles into suitable size and format while recording the latitude and longitude coordinates for each tile to be used in model training.
- Trains a YOLOv5 deep learning model by  The trained model has a high precision performing the solar panel detection task.
- utilizing satellite images of Amman in order to detect and map the location of PV solar panels in comercial and residential settin
-
- gs. The YOLOv5 deep learning model was trained by manually labeled images by me. The trained model has a high precision performing the solar panel detection task.

Note: The data used in this project is for demonstrative purpouses only, and is not intended for commercial use. The person using this code is solely responsible for gaining the permission and consent from the data owner/s for training and using the model.
